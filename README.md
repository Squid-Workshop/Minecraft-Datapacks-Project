## Overview
We have coded a lot of Minecraft data packs for our server, ranging from cosmetic add-ons to interesting mini games. Now we want to share our creations with the community. 

We used to lump all of our packs under /custom pack. However this is both not portable and hard to debug. Therefore, we decided to optimize by segregating it into individual packs, each with different functionalities. We will gradually release the optimized packs.

## Packs List
